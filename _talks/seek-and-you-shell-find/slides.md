-> What we'll cover
===

^
* a little history
^
* why?
^
* how to learn
^
* general tips

---

-> Not covered :(
===

* shell scripting
* vim
* git

---

-> A little (semi-ancient) history
===

^
* Morse code, and *teletype*, and the Datapoint 3300, oh my! ‚úá__‚úá
^
* Bell labs, *Unix*, and communal computing. üîî
^
* The kernel, the *shell*, and the utilities. üêö
^
* The *terminal*. üì∫ ‚å®Ô∏è

-> Be unix with me, do I really need to know this?
===

^
* MOAR CONTROL. One interface to rule them all. üíç
^
  * File management
  * Text processing
  > * Process management
  > * System level control
  > * Downloading files
  * Automation of all of the above
  * and much much more.
^
* Becuase NPM
  * Super useful with `npm run/yarn run` scripts.
  * A small shell script > npm install <something-shell-already-does>
^
* It's fun!
  * A piece of history.
  * Magical üîÆ

<!--
* speed of tasks
  * list of tasks

* if the task can be accomplished in shell

---

-> With great power comes great responsibility
===

^
* The assumption is that you know what you're doing
^
* e.g. `rm -rf /` (do not try this at home)

---

-> How do you learn, man?
===

^
-> *man* command

> man - format and display the on-line manual pages

```
man <any command>
```

^
* `man man`

^
*another tip*
  * bash builtins https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html

---

-> Navigation `man` using `less`
---

* arrow keys, j, k
* `/` to search
* G or g to navigate to the top/bottom

^
*tip*
   MANPAGER="less -FXi"


<!--
* how to navigate man pages
  * modify less

... That's a bit bruTL DeaR, got something simpler?

^
-> *tldr* command

^
Install
```
brew install tldr
```
^
Example...

---

# Aliases & Functions
^
* aliases
  ^
  * `alias` to list all aliases
  ^
  * setting default options

```
alias ls="ls --color=auto --group-directories-first --ignore='.DS_Store'"
```

^
* functions
  * aliases that take an argument
^
But where do you put these?...

---

# Bash profile

^
`.bash_profile`

^
```
| # ls aliases
| alias ll='ls -alF'
| alias la='ls -A'
| alias l='ls -CF'
|
| mktouch() {
|   if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
|     echo "Missing argument";
|     return 1;
|   fi
|
|   for f in "$@"; do
|     mkdir -p -- "$(dirname -- "$f")"
|     touch -- "$f"
|   done
| }
```

---

-> Piping
===

Pass text from one command to the next.

```
ls | grep '^_' | xargs -I {} mv {} __{}
```

---

-> Exit codes
===

^
* 0 success
^
* non-0 failure
^
* how do you evaluate the last exit code?
  ^
  * `echo $?`
^
* logical operators
  * &&
  * ||

# Tips

^
* setup your terminal
  * quick command for access to terminal

^
* Setup editor command: `subl`, `code`

# Exit codes
* exit statuses
  * 0 success
  * non-0 failure
  * how to evaluate `echo $?`
  * logical operators
    * &&
    * ||
^
* expansion/word splitting
  * wildcard expansion
^
