-> A little (semi-ancient) history

^
* Morse code, and *teletype*, and the Datapoint 3300, oh my! ‚úá__‚úá
^
* Bell labs, *Unix*, and communal computing. üîî

> What we wanted to preserve was not just a good environment
> in which to do programming, but a system around which a fellowship
> could form. We knew from experience that the essence of communal
> computing, [...] is not just to type programs into a terminal
> instead of a  keypunch, but to encourage close communication.
~ 1969, Dennis Ritchie
