- As necessary follow TDD pattern of writing tests first, running tests to verify they fail for correct reason, and then implement changes to make tests pass
- Always run lint --fix when available before commiting
- Never use "should" at the beginning of test descriptions. E.g. BAD it('should return wibble'). GOOD it('returns wibble')
